Notes on making amanda-client work on a Debian system


To get indexing (or specifically amrecover) to work right two things need
to be done:

1. Edit server's /etc/hosts.allow and allow all client machines into
   the daemons amindexd & amidxtaped.

2. Edit the server(s) ~backup/.amandahosts and add an entry like:
   "<client_hostname>   root"


As always: for more complex setups consult the manpages and available
documentation in /usr/share/doc/amanda-common ;-)

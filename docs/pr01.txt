Abstract


Note

This is the first release of the Docbook/XML-version of the official AMANDA
documentation. Please refer to http://www.amanda.org/docs/AMANDA-docs.html for
the latest versions of these documents. They are available as html, ps and pdf.
This is an effort to give the AMANDA-documentation a general overhaul. There
are many parts that need to be reviewed and corrected, updated and added. The
conversion of the old ASCII-formatted documentation to Docbook/XML should help
to enhance the possibilities and to ease the generation of various output-
formats.
Recent changes:

* addition of the AMANDA-chapter by John R. Jackson (with kind permission of W.
  Curtis Preston).

Planned:

* addition of some historical AMANDA-papers.
* addition of some illustrations and charts.
* addition of more chapters ...

Feel free to contact me with corrections, additions or updates. Thank you.
Stefan G. Weichinger, for the AMANDA Core Team, April 2005.

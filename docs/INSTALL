Amanda INSTALLATION NOTES

This document covers the compilation, installation, and runtime setup
of Amanda 2.4.2 and higher.

0. BEFORE DOING ANYTHING

    A.  Read this document all the way through.

    B.  Consult the docs/SYSTEM.NOTES file for installation notes
	specific to particular operating systems.  There is often
	important information there, so don't forget this step.

    C.  Read docs/UPGRADE if you are upgrading from a previous Amanda
	version.  There are some issues that you will need to be aware
	of.

    D.  If you are using KERBEROS authentication, read docs/KERBEROS
	for details on installing and running the kerberized version of
	Amanda.

    E.  Check the Amanda Patches Page, www.amanda.org/patches.html.

1. COMPILING THE AMANDA SOURCES

If you have multiple architectures, you only need to install the whole
Amanda package on the tape server host (the one with tape drive).  On
the backup client hosts (the ones you are going to dump), you only need
to compile some of the Amanda programs (see section 1.2.H below).

1.1. SOURCE CONFIGURATION:

    A.  Amanda can optionally make use of the following packages to
	back up different types of clients or clients with different
	filesystem dumping programs.  If you wish to use GNU tar to
	back up filesystems, we can install version 1.12 or 1.13.25.
	gnutar 1.12 can be found at:

		ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/tar/tar-1.12.tar.gz
 
	Apply the patch from patches/tar-1.12.patch.  The first hunk
	may be enough, unless it's a SunOS4 host.  Read more about the
	patches in the patch file itself.

	gnutar 1.13.25 can be found at:

		ftp://alpha.gnu.org/pub/gnu/tar/tar-1.13.25.tar.gz

	Samba allows Unix systems to talk to PC clients.  Amanda can
	back up Microsoft Windows clients using Samba:

		http://www.samba.org

	Read docs/SAMBA for configuration tips and known limitations.

	Look at http://www.amanda.org/patches.html for up to date
	information on patches.

    B.  If you wish to make use of some of the scripts that come with
	Amanda, you will need to install Perl.  You can get Perl from
	any CPAN site.  
	    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/src/perl-5.6.1.tar.gz


    C.  One of the programs included in this package is amplot,
	which reads a data file that Amanda generates for each dump
	and translates that information in it into a nice picture that
	can be used to determine how your installation is doing and if
	any parameters need to be changed.  To use amplot, you need a
	version of awk that understands command line variable
	substitutions, such as nawk or gawk, which is available from

	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gawk/gawk-3.1.1.tar.gz

	Amplot also required that gnuplot be installed on your system.
	Gnuplot is available at

	    http://www.gnuplot.org/
	    ftp://ftp.gnuplot.org/pub/gnuplot

    D.	The process of building Amanda requires that some other
	packages be installed on your system.  The following packages
	are used:

	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/readline/readline-4.2.tar.gz
		amrecover optionally uses the readline library for its
		command-line edition mechanisms.  This library itself
		requires either termcap, curses or ncurses.  termcap
		is preferred, and it may be obtained from:
	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/termcap/termcap-1.3.tar.gz

	If you wish to edit and enhance Amanda, you may need to install
	the following tools.  Autoconf and automake are required if you
	are going to rebuild the Makefiles and auto configuration scripts.
	Bison is only needed if you are going to work on the index server
	and client code.

	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/autoconf/autoconf-2.53.tar.gz
	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/automake/automake-1.6.3.tar.gz
	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/bison/bison-1.27.tar.gz
	    ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/flex/flex-2.5.4a.tar.gz

    E.  Read about the different configuration options available for
	building and running Amanda.  To see the options, do both:

	    a.  Run `./configure --help' to see the available options
		that configure takes.
	    b.  Read the example/config.site file which gives longer
		descriptions to the same options as in step a).

    F.  Choose which user and group you will run the dumps under.
	Common choices for user are `bin' or another user specifically
	created for Amanda, such as `amanda'; common choices for group
	are `operator' or `disk'.  If you do not specify
	--with-user=<username> and --with-group=<groupname>, configure
	will abort.  Also choose the default name for your
	configuration, such as `csd' or `DailySet1').  This name is
	used by the Amanda commands to choose one of multiple possible
	configurations.  You may specify it using the
	--with-config=<confgname>.

    G.  Decide where Amanda will live.  You need to choose a root
	directory for Amanda.  Let this root directory be called
	$prefix.  Unless you change the default behavior with the
	appropriate command line options, Amanda will install itself
	as.  Listed below each directory is the appropriate
	configure option to change the location of this part of
	Amanda.

	    $prefix/sbin		Amanda server side programs
					--sbindir=
	    $prefix/libexec		Amanda backup client programs
					--libexecdir=
	    $prefix/lib			Amanda dynamic libraries
					--libdir=
	    $prefix/etc/amanda		Runtime configuration files
					--with-configdir=
	    $prefix/var/amanda/gnutar-lists
					Directory for GNUtar lists (client)
					--with-gnutar-listdir=
	    $prefix/man			Directory for manual pages
					--mandir=

	Note that the GNU tar listdir should be a local filesystem on
	each client that is going to be backed up with GNU tar.  If it 
	really must be NFS-mounted, make sure the filesystem is
	exported so that the client has root access to it.

    H.  Decide if you are compiling Amanda on a server only or a
	client only platform.  If you have a particular operating system
	that will only be a Amanda client and will never run as the
	master tape host, then add the --without-server option to
	configure.  In the unlikely case that you have a particular
	operating system that will serve as the tape host and you do
	not wish to back up any machines that run this operating system,
	add the --without-client option to the configure options.
	There are many other configuration switches for amanda.  You
	may learn more about them by running `configure --help' and by
	reading examples/config.site.

    I.  Now configure Amanda.  There are two ways of doing this.  If
	you are running Amanda on a single OS, then probably the first
	method works better for you.  If you need to support multiple
	platforms, then the second method will work better.

	    a.  Run `configure' with the appropriate command line
		options.  You will probably want to remember the
		command line options for future builds of Amanda.

	    b.  Edit example/config.site and install it in the directory
		$prefix/etc or $prefix/share.  When `configure' runs
		the next time it will look for this file and use it to
		configure Amanda.

1.2. BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE BINARIES

    A.  Back at the top-level source directory, build the sources:
		1. make
		2. su root; make install
	If you want to change the compiler flags, you can do so like
	this:
		make CFLAGS="-O3 -Wall"

    B.  If you have built with USE_VERSION_SUFFIXES, you will want to
	create symlinks to the version you wish to use, eg:
		ln -s amdump-x.y.z amdump
	This is not done automatically by the install process, so that
	you can have multiple Amanda versions co-existing, and choose
	yourself which to make the default version.  The script
	contrib/set_prod_link.pl may save you some keystrokes.

2. SETTING UP YOUR AMANDA CONFIGURATION

2.1. SETTING UP THE TAPE SERVER HOST

    B.  Create the config directory (eg /usr/local/etc/amanda/confname)
	and copy the example/ files into that directory.  Edit these
	files to be correct for your site, consulting the amanda(8) man
	page if necessary.  You can also send mail to
	amanda-users@amanda.org if you are having trouble deciding how
	to set things up.  You will also need to create the directory
	for the log and database files for the configuration to use (eg
	/usr/local/var/amanda/confname), and the work directory on the
	holding disk.  These directories need to agree with the
	parameters in amanda.conf.  Don't forget to make all these
	directories writable by the dump user!

	Make sure that you specify the *no-rewind* version of the tape
	device in your amanda.conf file.  This is a frequently
	encountered problem for new sites.

	Note that you might want to temporarily set the "no-record"
	option in all your dumptypes when first installing amanda if
	you'd like to run tests of Amanda in parallel with your
	existing dump scheme.  Amanda will then run but will not
	interfere with your current dumpdates.  However, you don't want
	to run with "no-record" under normal operations.

    C.  Put amanda into your crontab.  Here's a sample:
		0 16 * * 1-5 /usr/local/bin/amcheck -m confname
		45 0 * * 2-6 /usr/local/bin/amdump confname
	This is for SunOS 4.x, which has a per-user crontab; most other
	systems also require a userid on each cron line.  See your
	cron(8) for details.  With these cron lines, Amanda will check
	that the correct tape is in the drive every weekday afternoon
	at 4pm (if it isn't, all the operators will get mail).  At
	12:45am that night the dumps will be run.

    D.  Put the Amanda services into your /etc/services file.  Add
	entries like:
		amanda		10080/udp
		amandaidx	10082/tcp
		amidxtape	10083/tcp
	You may choose a different port number if you like, but it must
	match that in the services file on the client hosts too.

	If you are running NIS (aka YP), you have to enter the amanda
	service into your NIS services database.  Consult your NIS
	documentation for details.

	You may use the `patch-system' script, from client-src, in
        order to modify this file.  Run it with a `-h' argument for
        usage.

    E.  If you are going to use the indexing capabilities of Amanda,
	and your server uses inetd, then add these to your inetd.conf
	on the tape server host:

	    amandaidx stream tcp nowait USER AMINDEXD_PATH amindexd
	    amidxtape stream tcp nowait USER AMIDXTAPED_PATH amidxtaped

	where AMINDEXD_PATH and AMIDXTAPED_PATH are the complete paths
	to where the amindexd and amidxtaped executables (usually
	libexec_dir/amindexd and libexec_dir/amidxtaped), and USER is
	the Amanda user.

	You may use the `patch-system' script, from client-src, in
        order to modify this file.  Run it with a `-h' argument for
        usage.

	If your tape server uses xinetd instead of inetd, then you have
	to add the following two files to your xinetd-configuration
	(usually /etc/xinetd.d):

	#/etc/xinetd.d/amandaidx

	service amandaidx
	{
		socket_type		= stream
		protocol		= tcp
		wait			= no
		user			= USER
		group			= GROUP
		groups 			= yes
		server			= AMINDEXD_PATH/amindexd 
	}

	#/etc/xinetd.d/amidxtaped

	service amidxtape
	{
		socket_type		= stream
		protocol		= tcp
		wait			= no
		user			= USER
		group			= GROUP
		groups 			= yes
		server			= AMIDXTAPED_PATH/amidxtaped
	}

    F.  If the tape server host is itself going to be backed up (as is
	usually the case), you must also follow the client-side install
	instructions below on the server host, INCLUDING setting up the
	.amandahosts file so that the server host lets itself in.
	This is a frequently encountered problem for new sites.


2.2. SET UP THE BACKUP CLIENT HOSTS

    A.  When using BSD-style security (enabled by default), set up
	your ~dumpuser/.amandahosts (or ~dumpuser/.rhosts and/or
	/etc/hosts.equiv, if you have configured
	--without-amandahosts) so that the dumpuser is allowed in from
	the server host.  Only canonical host names will be accepted
	in .amandahosts, and usernames must be present in every line,
	because this is safer.

    B.  Set up your raw disk devices so that the dumpuser can read
	them, and /etc/dumpdates so that the dumpuser can write to it.
	Normally this is done by making the disk devices readable by
	(and dumpdates read/writable by) group `operator', and putting
	the dumpuser into that group.

    C.  Put the Amanda service into your /etc/services file.  Add
	entry like:
		amanda		10080/udp
		amandaidx	10082/tcp
		amidxtape	10083/tcp
	You may choose a different port number if you like, but it must
	match that in the services file on the client hosts too.

	If you are running NIS (aka YP), you have to enter the amanda
	service into your NIS services database.  Consult your NIS
	documentation for details.

	You may use the `patch-system' script, from client-src, in
        order to modify this file.  Run it with a `-h' argument for
        usage.

    D.  If your Amanda client uses inetd, put the Amanda client service 
	into inetd's config file.  
	This file is usually found in /etc/inetd.conf, but on older systems
	it is /etc/servers.  The format is different on different OSes,
	so you must consult the inetd man page for your site.  Here is
	an example from our site, again from SunOS 4.x:

	    amanda dgram udp wait USER AMANDAD_PATH amandad

	You may use the `patch-system' script, from client-src, in
        order to modify this file.  Run it with a `-h' argument for
        usage.

	If your Amanda client uses xinetd, you have to add the following
	file to your xinetd-configuration
        (usually /etc/xinetd.d):

	#/etc/xinetd.d/amanda

	service amanda
	{
		socket_type		= dgram
		protocol		= udp
		wait			= yes
		user			= USER
		group			= GROUP
		groups 			= yes
		server			= AMANDAD_PATH/amandad 
	}

    E.  Kick inetd/xinetd to make it read its config file.  On most systems
	you can just kill -HUP inetd (or xinetd). On older systems you may have to
	kill it completely and restart it.  Note that
	killing/restarting (x)inetd is not safe to do unless you are sure
	that no (x)inetd services (like rlogin) are currently in use,
	otherwise (x)inetd will not be able to bind that port and that
	service will be unavailable.

    F.  If you intend to back up xfs filesystems on hosts running IRIX,
	you must create the directory /var/xfsdump/inventory, otherwise
	xfsdump will not work.

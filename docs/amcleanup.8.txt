Name

amcleanup  run the AMANDA cleanup process after a failure

Synopsis

amcleanup config

DESCRIPTION

Amcleanup generates the AMANDA Mail Report and updates the AMANDA databases
after a system failure on a tape server host. This cleanup process is normally
done automatically as part of the amdump program, but if amdump cannot complete
for some reason (usually because of a tape server host crash), amcleanup must
be run some time later (usually during system boot).
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about AMANDA.

EXAMPLES

This example runs the AMANDA cleanup process by hand after a failure.

  % amcleanup daily

Putting the following line in a system boot script (e.g. /etc/rc.local) runs
the AMANDA cleanup process as part of the reboot, eliminating the need to run
it by hand.

  /usr/local/sbin/amcleanup daily

If nothing needs to be done, amcleanup exits normally with the message:

  amcleanup: no unprocessed logfile to clean up.

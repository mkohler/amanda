Name

amdump  back up all disks in an AMANDA configuration

Synopsis

amdump config [ host [disk...]...]

DESCRIPTION

Amdump switches to the appropriate AMANDA configuration directory, e.g. /usr/
local/etc/amanda/config, then attempts to back up every disk specified by the
amanda.conf file. Amdump is normally run by cron.
You can specify many host/disk expressions, only disks that match an expression
will be dumped. All disks are dumped if no expressions are given.
If the file /usr/local/etc/amanda/config/hold exists, amdump will wait until it
is removed before starting the backups. This allows scheduled backups to be
delayed when circumstances warrant, for example, if the tape device is being
used for some other purpose. While waiting, amdump checks for the hold file
every minute.
See the amanda(8) man page for more details about AMANDA.

EXAMPLE

Here is a typical crontab entry. It runs amdump every weeknight at 1 a.m. as
user bin:

  0 1 * * 1-5 bin /usr/local/sbin/amdump daily

Please see the crontab(5) or crontab(1) manual page for the correct crontab
format for your system.

MESSAGES



  amdump: waiting for hold file to be removed
      The "hold" file exists and amdump is waiting for it to be removed before
      starting backups.

  amdump: amdump or amflush is already running, or you must run amcleanup
      Amdump detected another amdump or amflush running, or the remains of a
      previous incomplete amdump or amflush run. This run is terminated. If the
      problem is caused by the remains of a previous run, you must execute
      amcleanup(8) and then rerun amdump.

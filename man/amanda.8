.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBAMANDA\fR is the "Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver"\&. This manual page gives an overview of the \fBAMANDA\fR commands and configuration files for quick reference\&.

.PP
Here are all the \fBAMANDA\fR commands\&. Each one has its own manual page\&. See them for all the gory details\&.

.TP
\fBamdump\fR
Take care of automatic \fBAMANDA\fR backups\&. This is normally executed by \fBcron\fR on a computer called the \fBtape server host\fR and requests backups of file systems located on \fBbackup\fR  \fBclients\fR\&. \fBAmdump\fR backs up all disks in the \fBdisklist\fR file (discussed below) to tape or, if there is a problem, to a special \fBholding\fR  \fBdisk\fR\&. After all backups are done, \fBamdump\fR sends mail reporting failures and successes\&.

.TP
\fBamflush\fR
Flush backups from the holding disk to tape\&. \fBAmflush\fR is used after \fBamdump\fR has reported it could not write backups to tape for some reason\&. When this happens, backups stay in the holding disk\&. Run \fBamflush\fR after the tape problem is corrected to write backups from the holding disk to tape\&.

.TP
\fBamcleanup\fR
Clean up after an interrupted \fBamdump\fR\&. This command is only needed if \fBamdump\fR was unable to complete for some reason, usually because the tape server host crashed while \fBamdump\fR was running\&.

.TP
\fBamrecover\fR
Provides an interactive interface to browse the \fBAMANDA\fR index files (backup image catalogues) and select which tapes to recover files from\&. It can also run \fBamrestore\fR and a restore program (e\&.g\&. \fBtar\fR) to actually recover the files\&.

.TP
\fBamrestore\fR
Read an \fBAMANDA\fR tape, searching for requested backups\&. \fBAmrestore\fR is suitable for everything from interactive restores of single files to a full restore of all partitions on a failed disk\&.

.TP
\fBamlabel\fR
Write an \fBAMANDA\fR format label onto a tape\&. All \fBAMANDA\fR tapes must be labeled with \fBamlabel\fR\&. \fBAmdump\fR and \fBamflush\fR will not write to an unlabeled tape (see TAPE MANAGEMENT below)\&.

.TP
\fBamcheck\fR
Verify the correct tape is mounted and all file systems on all backup client systems are ready to be backed up\&. Often run by \fBcron\fR before \fBamdump\fR to generate a mail warning that backups might fail unless corrective action is taken\&.

.TP
\fBamadmin\fR
Take care of administrative tasks like finding out which tapes are needed to restore a filesystem, forcing hosts to do full backups of selected disks and looking at schedule balance information\&.

.TP
\fBamtape\fR
Take care of tape changer control operations like loading particular tapes, ejecting tapes and scanning the tape storage slots\&.

.TP
\fBamverify\fR
Check \fBAMANDA\fR backup tapes for errors\&.

.TP
\fBamrmtape\fR
Delete a tape from the \fBAMANDA\fR databases\&.

.TP
\fBamstatus\fR
Report the status of a running or completed \fBamdump\fR\&.

.TP
\fBamoverview\fR
Display a chart of hosts and file systems backed up every run\&.

.TP
\fBamplot\fR
Generate utilization plots of \fBAMANDA\fR runs for performance tuning\&.

.TP
\fBamreport\fR
Generate an \fBAMANDA\fR summary E\-mail report\&.

.TP
\fBamtoc\fR
Generate table of content files for \fBAMANDA\fR tapes\&.

.TP
\fBamcheckdb\fR
Verify every tape \fBAMANDA\fR knows about is consistent in the database\&.

.TP
\fBamgetconf\fR
Look up parameters in the \fBAMANDA\fR configuration file\&.

.TP
\fBamtapetype\fR
Generate a tapetype definition\&.

.SH "CONFIGURATION"

.PP
There are three user\-editable files that control the behavior of \fBAMANDA\fR\&.

.PP
The first is \fBamanda\&.conf\fR, the main configuration file\&. It contains parameters to customize \fBAMANDA\fR for the site\&. Refer to the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR(5), manpage for details on \fBAMANDA\fR configuration parameters\&.

.PP
Second is the \fBdisklist\fR file, which lists hosts and disk partitions to back up\&.

.PP
Third is the \fBtapelist\fR file, which lists tapes that are currently active\&. These files are described in more detail in the following sections\&.

.PP
All files are stored in individual configuration directories under \fI/usr/local/etc/amanda/\fR\&. A site will often have more than one configuration\&. For example, it might have a \fBnormal\fR configuration for everyday backups and an \fBarchive\fR configuration for infrequent full archival backups\&. The configuration files would be stored under directories \fI/usr/local/etc/amanda/normal/\fR and \fI/usr/local/etc/amanda/archive/\fR, respectively\&. Part of the job of an \fBAMANDA\fR administrator is to create, populate and maintain these directories\&.

.PP
All log and database files generated by \fBAMANDA\fR go in corresponding directories somewhere\&. The exact location is controlled by entries in \fBamanda\&.conf\fR\&. A typical location would be under \fI/var/adm/amanda\fR\&. For the above example, the files might go in \fI/var/adm/amanda/normal/\fR and \fI/var/adm/amanda/archive/\fR\&.

.PP
As log files are no longer needed (no longer contain relevant information), \fBAMANDA\fR cycles them out in various ways, depending on the type of file\&.

.PP
Detailed information about \fBamdump\fR runs are stored in files named \fBamdump\&.\fR\fBNN\fR where \fBNN\fR is a sequence number, with 1 being the most recent file\&. \fBAmdump\fR rotates these files each run, keeping roughly the last \fBtapecycle\fR (see below) worth of them\&.

.PP
The file used by \fBamreport\fR to generate the mail summary is named \fBlog\&.\fR\fBYYYYMMDD\&.NN\fR where \fBYYYYMMDD\fR is the datestamp of the start of the \fBamdump\fR run and \fBNN\fR is a sequence number started at 0\&. At the end of each \fBamdump\fR run, log files for runs whose tapes have been reused are renamed into a subdirectory of the main log directory (see the \fBlogdir\fR parameter below) named \fBoldlog\fR\&. It is up to the \fBAMANDA\fR administrator to remove them from this directory when desired\&.

.PP
Index (backup image catalogue) files older than the full dump matching the oldest backup image for a given client and disk are removed by \fBamdump\fR at the end of each run\&.

.SH "DISKLIST FILE"

.PP
The \fBdisklist\fR file determines which disks will be backed up by \fBAMANDA\fR\&. The file usually contains one line per disk:
.nf

\fBhostname diskname\fR [\fBdiskdevice\fR] \fBdumptype\fR [\fBspindle\fR [\fBinterface\fR] ]
.fi

.PP
All pairs [ \fBhostname diskname\fR ] must be unique\&.

.PP
Lines starting with # are ignored, as are blank lines\&. The fields have the following meanings:

.TP
\fBhostname\fR
The name of the host to be backed up\&. If \fBdiskdevice\fR refers to a PC share, this is the host \fBAMANDA\fR will run the Samba \fBsmbclient\fR program on to back up the share\&.

.TP
\fBdiskname\fR
The name of the disk (a label)\&. In most case, you set your \fBdiskname\fR to the \fBdiskdevice\fR and you don't set the \fBdiskdevice\&.\fR If you want multiple entries with the same \fBdiskdevice\fR, you must set a different \fBdiskname\fR for each entry\&. It's the \fBdiskname\fR that you use on the commandline for any \fBAMANDA\fR command\&. Look at the example/disklist file for example\&.

.TP
\fBdiskdevice\fR
Default: same as diskname\&. The name of the disk device to be backed up\&. It may be a full device name, a device name without the \fI/dev/\fR prefix, e\&.g\&. \fBsd0a\fR, or a mount point such as \fI/usr\fR\&.

It may also refer to a PC share by starting the name with two (forward) slashes, e\&.g\&. \fI//some\-pc/home\fR\&. In this case, the \fBprogram\fR option in the associated \fBdumptype\fR must be entered as \fBGNUTAR\fR\&. It is the combination of the double slash disk name and \fBprogram GNUTAR\fR in the \fBdumptype\fR that triggers the use of Samba\&.

.TP
\fBdumptype\fR
Refers to a \fBdumptype\fR defined in the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR file\&. \fBDumptype\fRs specify backup related parameters, such as whether to compress the backups, whether to record backup results in \fI/etc/dumpdates\fR, the disk's relative priority, etc\&.

.TP
\fBspindle\fR
Default: \fB\-1\fR\&. A number used to balance backup load on a host\&. \fBAMANDA\fR will not run multiple backups at the same time on the same spindle, unless the spindle number is \-1, which means there is no spindle restriction\&.

.TP
\fBinterface\fR
Default: \fBlocal\fR\&. The name of a network interface definition in the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR file, used to balance network load\&.

.PP
Instead of naming a \fBdumptype\fR, it is possible to define one in\-line, enclosing \fBdumptype\fR options within curly braces, one per line, just like a \fBdumptype\fR definition in \fBamanda\&.conf\fR\&. Since pre\-existing \fBdumptype\fRs are valid option names, this syntax may be used to customize \fBdumptype\fRs for particular disks\&.

.PP
A line break \fBmust\fR follow the left curly bracket\&.

.PP
For instance, if a \fBdumptype\fR named \fBnormal\fR is used for most disks, but use of the holding disk needs to be disabled for the file system that holds it, this would work instead of defining a new dumptype:
.nf

\fBhostname diskname\fR [ \fBdiskdevice\fR ] {
  normal
  holdingdisk no
} [ \fBspindle\fR [ \fBinterface\fR ] ]
.fi

.SH "TAPE MANAGEMENT"

.PP
The \fBtapelist\fR file contains the list of tapes in active use\&. This file is maintained entirely by \fBAMANDA\fR and should not be created or edited during normal operation\&. It contains lines of the form:

.PP

.nf
YYYYMMDD label flags
.fi


.PP
Where \fBYYYYMMDD\fR is the date the tape was written, \fBlabel\fR is a label for the tape as written by \fBamlabel\fR and \fBflags\fR tell \fBAMANDA\fR whether the tape may be reused, etc (see the \fBreuse\fR options of \fBamadmin\fR)\&.

.PP
\fBAmdump\fR and \fBamflush\fR will refuse to write to an unlabeled tape, or to a labeled tape that is considered active\&. There must be more tapes in active rotation (see the \fBtapecycle\fR option) than there are runs in the backup cycle (see the \fBdumpcycle\fR option) to prevent overwriting a backup image that would be needed to do a full recovery\&.

.SH "OUTPUT DRIVERS"

.PP
The normal value for the \fBtapedev\fR parameter, or for what a tape changer returns, is a full path name to a non\-rewinding tape device, such as \fI/dev/nst0\fR or \fI/dev/rmt/0mn\fR or \fI/dev/nst0\&.1\fR or whatever conventions the operating system uses\&. \fBAMANDA\fR provides additional application level drivers that support non\-traditional tape\-simulations or features\&. To access a specific output driver, set \fBtapedev\fR (or configure your changer to return) a string of the form \fBdriver\fR:\fBdriver\-info\fR where \fBdriver\fR is one of the supported drivers and \fBdriver\-info\fR is optional additional information needed by the driver\&.

.PP
The supported drivers are:

.TP
\fBtape\fR
This is the default driver\&. The \fBdriver\-info\fR is the tape device name\&. Entering 
.nf
tapedev /dev/rmt/0mn
.fi
 is really a short hand for 
.nf
tapedev tape:/dev/rmt/0mn
.fi
\&.

.TP
\fBnull\fR
This driver throws away anything written to it and returns EOF for any reads except a special case is made for reading a label, in which case a "fake" value is returned that \fBAMANDA\fR checks for and allows through regardless of what you have set in \fBlabelstr\fR\&. The \fBdriver\-info\fR field is not used and may be left blank:


.nf
tapedev null:
.fi


The \fBlength\fR value from the associated \fBtapetype\fR is used to limit the amount of data written\&. When the limit is reached, the driver will simulate end of tape\&.

.RS
.Sh "Note"
This driver should only be used for debugging and testing,
and probably only with the
\fBrecord\fR
option set to
\fBno\fR\&.
.RE

.TP
\fBrait\fR
\fBR\fRedundant \fBA\fRrray of \fBI\fRnexpensive (?) \fBT\fRapes\&. Reads and writes tapes mounted on multiple drives by spreading the data across N\-1 drives and using the last drive for a checksum\&. See docs/RAIT for more information\&.

The \fBdriver\-info\fR field describes the devices to use\&. Curly braces indicate multiple replacements in the string\&. For instance:


.nf
tapedev rait:/dev/rmt/tps0d{4,5,6}n
.fi


would use the following devices:

\fI/dev/rmt/tps0d4n\fR  \fI/dev/rmt/tps0d5n\fR  \fI/dev/rmt/tps0d6n\fR 

.TP
\fBfile\fR
This driver emulates a tape device with a set of files in a directory\&. The \fBdriver\-info\fR field must be the name of an existing directory\&. The driver will test for a subdirectory of that named \fBdata\fR and return \fBoffline\fR until it is present\&. When present, the driver uses two files in the \fBdata\fR subdirectory for each tape file\&. One contains the actual data\&. The other contains record length information\&.

The driver uses a file named \fBstatus\fR in the \fBfile\fR device directory to hold driver status information, such as tape position\&. If not present, the driver will create it as though the device is rewound\&.

The \fBlength\fR value from the associated \fBtapetype\fR is used to limit the amount of data written\&. When the limit is reached, the driver will simulate end of tape\&.

One way to use this driver with a real device such as a CD\-writer is to create a directory for the \fBfile\fR device and one or more other directories for the actual data\&. Create a symlink named \fBdata\fR in the \fBfile\fR directory to one of the data directories\&. Set the \fBtapetype\fR length to whatever the medium will hold\&.

When \fBAMANDA\fR fills the \fBfile\fR device, remove the symlink and (optionally) create a new symlink to another data area\&. Use a CD writer software package to burn the image from the first data area\&.

To read the CD, mount it and create the \fBdata\fR symlink in the \fBfile\fR device directory\&.

.SH "AUTHORIZATION"

.PP
\fBAMANDA\fR processes on the tape server host run as the \fBdumpuser\fR user listed in \fBamanda\&.conf\fR\&. When they connect to a backup client, they do so with an \fBAMANDA\fR\-specific protocol\&. They do not, for instance, use \fBrsh\fR or \fBssh\fR directly\&.

.PP
On the client side, the \fBamandad\fR daemon validates the connection using one of several methods, depending on how it was compiled and on options it is passed:

.TP
\&.rhosts
Even though \fBAMANDA\fR does not use \fBrsh\fR, it can use \&.rhosts\-style authentication and a \&.rhosts file\&.

.TP
\&.amandahosts
This is essentially the same as \&.rhosts authentication except a different file, with almost the same format, is used\&. This is the default mechanism built into \fBAMANDA\fR\&.

The format of the \fI\&.amandahosts\fR file is:

\fBhostname\fR [ \fBusername\fR ]

If \fBusername\fR is ommitted, it defaults to the user running \fBamandad\fR, i\&.e\&. the user listed in the \fBinetd\fR or \fBxinetd\fR configuration file\&.

.TP
Kerberos
\fBAMANDA\fR may use the Kerberos authentication system\&. Further information is in the \fBdocs/KERBEROS\fR   file that comes with an \fBAMANDA\fR distribution\&.

For Samba access, \fBAMANDA\fR needs a file on the Samba server (which may or may not also be the tape server) named \fI/etc/amandapass\fR with share names, (clear text) passwords and (optional) domain names, in that order, one per line, whitespace separated\&. By default, the user used to connect to the PC is the same for all PC's and is compiled into \fBAMANDA\fR\&. It may be changed on a host by host basis by listing it first in the password field followed by a percent sign and then the password\&. For instance:

.nf

  //some\-pc/home normalpw
  //another\-pc/disk otheruser%otherpw.fi
With clear text passwords, this file should obviously be tightly protected\&. It only needs to be readable by the \fBAMANDA\fR\-user on the Samba server\&.

You can find further information in the \fBdocs/SAMBA\fR   file that comes with an \fBAMANDA\fR distribution\&.

.SH "HOST & DISK EXPRESSION"

.PP
All host and disk arguments to programs are special expressions\&. The command applies to all disks that match your arguments\&. This section describes the matcher\&.

.PP
The matcher matches by word, each word is a glob expression, words are separated by the separator '\&.' for host and '/' for disk\&. You can anchor the expression at left with a '^'\&. You can anchor the expression at right with a '$'\&. The matcher is case insensitive for host but is case sensitive for disk\&. A match succeeds if all words in your expression match contiguous words in the host or disk\&.
\&. word separator for a host/ word separator for a disk^ anchor at left$ anchor at right? match exactly one character except the separator* match zero or more characters except the separator**match zero or more characters including the separator

.SH "DATESTAMP EXPRESSION"

.PP
A \fBdatestamp\fR expression is a range expression where we only match the prefix\&. Leading ^ is removed\&. Trailing $ forces an exact match\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBAmoverview\fR displays a chart showing hosts and file systems processed by \fBAMANDA\fR along with the backup level performed each day\&.

.PP
See the \fBamanda\fR(8) man page for more details about \fBAMANDA\fR\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-config\fR \fIconfig\fR
Use configuration \fBconfig\fR instead of configuration daily\&.

.TP
\fB\-hostwidth\fR \fIwidth\fR
Set \fBhost\fR field column width to \fBwidth\fR characters instead of 8\&.

.TP
\fB\-diskwidth\fR \fIwidth\fR
Set \fBdisk\fR field column width to \fBwidth\fR characters instead of 20\&.

.TP
\fB\-skipmissed\fR
Compacts the output by only printing stats for the days \fBAMANDA\fR actually ran\&.

.TP
\fB\-last\fR
Outputs the last status of each disk at the start.  Useful for long tapecycles and/or sparse reports\&.

.TP
\fB\-num0\fR
Outputs the number of level 0 dumps for each disk\&.

.TP
\fB\-togo0\fR
Outputs the number of runs until the last level 0 dump is overwritten\&.

.TP
\fB\-verbose\fR
\fBAmoverview\fR can take a long while on large systems\&. This option reports intermediate steps while it is working\&.

.SH "RESULTS"

.PP
\fBamoverview\fR is a summary of the output of " \fBamadmin <config> find\fR "\&. When the last column of \fBamadmin find\fR contains anything other than "OK", amoverview translates this into "E" for that day\&.

.PP
A number indicates the level of backup and it succeeded\&. An "E" indicates an error for that day\&. You get an "E" for all errors, like failed to connect, datatimeout, computer crashed, etc, but also for failing to write to tape\&.

.PP
You can have an "E" followed by a number if a filesystem ran into end\-of\-tape once (gives an "E", and later that day, you flush it to a second tape (a number: the level, indicating success)\&. If the flush failed too, you get a double "EE" for that day\&.

.PP
You can also have a double code if you have two tapes in the changer and \fBAMANDA\fR failed to write to tape the first time because it hit end of tape (resulting in "E0", for a full, "E1" for an incremental etc\&.) or twice with error ("EE"), and may a successful flush afterwards giving maybe "EE0"\&. (Only the latest 2 characters are printed)\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
This shows the \fI/home\fR file system on \fBhost2\fR was backed up at level 3 on the 8th, 9th and 10th of December, had a full backup on the 11th, a level 1 on the 12th and a level 2 on the 13th\&.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBAmflush\fR writes \fBAMANDA\fR backups from the holding disks to tape, and updates the \fBAMANDA\fR info database and tapelist accordingly\&. Backups may stay in a holding disk when something is wrong with the tape at the time \fBamdump\fR is run\&. When this happens, the problem must be corrected and \fBamflush\fR run by hand\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-b\fR
Run \fBamflush\fR in batch mode\&. All datestamps are selected unless specified\&. The flush is started without confirmation\&.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Run \fBamflush\fR in foreground\&. \fBAmflush\fR normally detaches itself from the tty and runs as a background process\&. With the \fB\-f\fR option, \fBamflush\fR stays in the foreground\&. This is useful if \fBamflush\fR is run as part of another script that, for example, advances the tape after the flush is completed\&.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR
Write log to stdout/stderr instead of the amflush log file\&. Requires the \fB\-f\fR option\&.

.TP
\fB\-D datestamp\fR
specify a datestamp expression you want to flush, see the ``\fBDATESTAMP EXPRESSION\fR'' section of \fBamanda\fR(8) for a description\&. \fB\-D 20001225\-7\fR will flush all dumps from 25 december 2000 to 27 december 2000\&.

.PP
You can specify many host/disk expressions, only disks that match an expression will be flushed\&. All disks are flushed if no expressions are given\&. see the ``\fBHOST & DISK EXPRESSION\fR'' section of \fBamanda\fR(8) for a description\&.

.PP
\fBAmflush\fR will look in the holding disks specified by the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR file in /usr/local/etc/amanda/\fBconfig\fR for any non\-empty \fBAMANDA\fR work directories\&. It then prompts you to select a directory or to process all of the directories\&. The work directories in the holding disks are named by the date at the time \fBamdump\fR was run, e\&.g\&. 19910215\&.

.PP
See the \fBamanda\fR(8) man page for more details about \fBAMANDA\fR\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
\fBAmflush\fR will search for holding areas associated with the \fBdaily\fR configuration\&. After you select which holding area to flush, \fBamflush\fR writes the data to tape, updates the databases and sends a mail report similar to \fBamdump\fR(8)\&.
.nf

% amflush daily
Scanning /amanda\-hold\&.\&.\&.
  20001113: found \fBAMANDA\fR directory\&.
  20001114: found \fBAMANDA\fR directory\&.

Multiple \fBAMANDA\fR directories, please pick one by letter:
  A\&. 20001113
  B\&. 20001114
Select directories to flush [A\&.\&.B]: [ALL] all

Flushing dumps in 20001113, 20001114,
today: 20001117
to tape drive /dev/rmt/0mn\&.
Expecting tape DMP014 or a new tape\&.  (The last dumps were to tape DMP013)
Are you sure you want to do this? yes
Running in background, you can log off now\&.
You'll get mail when amflush is finished\&.

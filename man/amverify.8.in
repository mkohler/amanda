.TH AMVERIFY 8
.SH NAME
amverify \- check an Amanda tape for errors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B amverify
.I config
[
.I slot
[
.I runtapes
]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Amverify
reads an Amanda format tape and makes sure each backup image
can be processed by
.B amrestore
and, if possible, the appropriate restore program (e.g.\&
.BR tar ).
.LP
.B Amverify
runs
.B amrestore
on each file of the tape and pipes the output
to a restore program (if available) with an option to create a catalogue
of the backup.
The catalogue itself is discarded.
Only the success or failure of the operation itself is reported.
.LP
If the backup image cannot be processed by the restore program,
e.g. if it was written on a different operating system,
the image is sent through
.B dd
to /dev/null.
This still determines if the tape is readable,
but does not do any internal consistency check on the image.
.LP
If
.I config
is set up to use a tape changer,
the
.I slot
argument may be used to choose the first tape to process.
Otherwise,
the
.B current
slot is used.
.LP
The
.B runtapes
configuration parameter determines how many tapes are processed unless
it is specified on the command line.
.LP

.IR amanda (8)
man page for more details about Amanda.

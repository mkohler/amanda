.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
All \fBAMANDA\fR tapes must be pre\-labeled before they are used\&. \fBAMANDA\fR verifies the label in \fBamdump\fR and \fBamflush\fR before writing to make sure the proper tape is loaded\&.

.PP
\fBAmlabel\fR writes an \fBAMANDA\fR label on the tape in the device specified by the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR file in /usr/local/etc/amanda/\fBconfig\fR\&. \fBLabel\fR may be any string that does not contain whitespace and that matches the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR  \fBlabelstr\fR regular expression option\&. It is up to the system administrator to define a naming convention\&.

.PP
\fBAmlabel\fR appends the new tape to the \fBtapelist\fR file so it will be used by \fBAMANDA\fR before it reuses any other tapes\&. When you \fBamlabel\fR multiple tapes, they will be used in the order you \fBamlabel\fR them\&.

.PP
\fBAmlabel\fR will not write the label if the tape contains an active \fBAMANDA\fR tape or if the label specified is on an active tape\&. The \fB\-f\fR (force) flag bypasses these verifications\&.

.PP
An optional \fBslot\fR may be specified after the tape label\&. If a tape changer is in use, \fBamlabel\fR will label the tape in the specified slot instead of the currently loaded tape\&.

.PP
See the \fBamanda\fR(8) man page for more details about \fBAMANDA\fR\&.

.SH "EXAMPLE"

.PP
Write an \fBAMANDA\fR label with the string ``\fBDMP000\fR'' on the tape loaded in the device named in the \fBtapedev\fR option in /usr/local/etc/amanda/daily/amanda\&.conf:
.nf

% amlabel daily DMP000 
.fi

.PP
Label the tape in slot 3 of the currently configured tape changer with the string ``\fBDMP003\fR'':
.nf

% amlabel daily DMP003 slot 3 
.fi

.SH "MESSAGES"

.TP
label \fBlabel\fR doesn't match labelstr \fBstr\fR
Label \fBlabel\fR on the command line does not match the \fBlabelstr\fR regular expression \fBstr\fR from \fBamanda\&.conf\fR\&.

.TP
label \fBlabel\fR already on a tape
Label \fBlabel\fR is already listed as an active \fBAMANDA\fR tape\&.

.TP
no tpchanger specified in \fBpath\fR , so slot command invalid
The command line has the \fBslot\fR parameter but the \fBamanda\&.conf\fR file in \fBpath\fR does not have a tape changer configured\&.

.TP
reading label \fBlabel\fR, tape is in another amanda configuration
This tape appears to be a valid \fBAMANDA\fR tape, but label does not match \fBlabelstr\fR for this configuration so it is probably part of a different \fBAMANDA\fR configuration\&.

.TP
reading label \fBlabel\fR, tape is active
Tape \fBlabel\fR appears to already be part of this \fBAMANDA\fR configuration and active, i\&.e\&. has valid data on it\&.

.TP
no label found, are you sure \fBtape\fR is non\-rewinding?
While checking that the label was written correctly, \fBamlabel\fR got an error that might be caused by mis\-configuring \fBAMANDA\fR with a rewinding tape device name instead of a non\-rewinding device name for \fBtape\&.\fR

.SH "NAME"
amanda.conf \- Main configuration file for Amanda, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBamanda.conf\fR(5)
is the main configuration file for Amanda\&. This manpage lists the relevant sections and parameters of this file for quick reference\&.
.PP
The file
\fB<CONFIG_DIR>/<config>/amanda\&.conf\fR
is loaded\&.
.SH "SYNTAX"
.PP
There are a number of configuration parameters that control the behavior of the Amanda programs\&. All have default values, so you need not specify the parameter in
\fBamanda\&.conf\fR
if the default is suitable\&.
.SS "COMMENTS"
.PP
Lines starting with # are ignored, as are blank lines\&. Comments may be placed on a line with a directive by starting the comment with a #\&. The remainder of the line is ignored\&.
.SS "KEYWORDS AND IDENTIFIERS"
.PP
Keywords are case insensitive, i\&.e\&.
\fBmailto\fR
and
\fBMailTo\fR
are treated the same\&. Also, the characters \'\fB\-\fR\' and \'\fB_\fR\' are interchangeable in all predefined Amanda keywords:
\fBdevice_property\fR
and
\fBdevice\-property\fR
have the same meaning\&.
.PP
Identifiers are names which are defined in the configuration itself, such as dumptypes or interfaces\&. Identifiers are are case\-insensitive, but sensitive to \'\fB\-\fR\' vs\&. \'\fB_\fR\'\&. Identifiers should be quoted in the configuration file, although For historical reasons, the quotes are optional\&.
.PP
Strings are always quoted with double quotes ("), and any double quotes or backslashes within the string are escaped with a backslash:
.sp
.nf
tapelist "/path/to/tapelist"
property "escaped\-string" "escaping: \e\e (backslash) and \e" (double\-quote)"
.fi
.PP
To summarize, then:
.sp
.nf
                          # QUOTES        CASE            \-/_
logdir "logs"             # required      sensitive       sensitive
send\-amreport\-on strange  # prohibited    insensitive     insensitive
tapetype "EXABYTE"        # optional      insensitive     sensitive

define dumptype "dt" {    # optional      insensitive     sensitive
  "dumptype\-common"       # optional      insensitive     sensitive
  strategy noincr         # prohibited    insensitive     insensitive
}
.fi
.SS "VALUE SUFFIXES"
.PP
Integer arguments may have one of the following (case insensitive) suffixes, some of which have a multiplier effect:
.PP

Boolean arguments may have any of the values
\fB1\fR,
\fBy\fR,
\fByes\fR,
\fBt\fR,
\fBtrue\fR
or
\fBon\fR
to indicate a true state, or
\fB0\fR,
\fBn\fR,
\fBno\fR,

\fBfalse\fR
or
\fBoff\fR
to indicate a false state\&. If no argument is given,
\fBtrue\fR
is assumed\&.

.RE
.SS "PARAMETER ORDER"
.PP
In general, the order in which parameters occur in the configuration file does not matter, with the exception of subsection inheritance\&. For example, if dumptype "normal\-encrypt" which inherits from dumptype "normal", then "normal" must appear first in the configuration file\&.
.SS "STRINGS"
.PP
Quoted strings in Amanda follow a common, C\-like syntax\&. Printable characters and whitespace are kept as\-is, except that the backslash character (\e) is used as an escape character, and a double\-quote ends the string\&. The allowed escape sequences are
.sp
.nf
    ESCAPE SEQUENCE     BECOMES
    \e\e                  \e
    \e"                  "
    \en                  (newline)
    \et                  (tab)
    \er                  (carriage return)
    \ef                  (form\-feed)
    \e1 \- \e7
    \e01 \- \e77
    \e001 \- \e377         (character specified in octal)
.fi
Illegally quoted strings are handled on a "best\-effort" basis, which may lead to unexpected results\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.nf
finserver "/data/finance/XYZ Corp\'s \e"real\e" finances" finance\-high eth0 \-1
property "syspath" "C:\e\eWINDOWS\e\eSYSTEM"
.fi
.SS "SUBSECTIONS AND INHERITANCE"
.PP
Amanda configuration files may include various
\fIsubsections\fR, each defining a set of configuration directives\&. Each type of subsection is described below\&. Note that all types of subsections can
\fIinherit\fR
from other subsections of the same type by naming the "parent" section in the "child" subsection\&. For example:
.sp
.nf
define dumptype global {
    record yes
    index yes
}

define dumptype nocomp {
    global      # inherit the parameters in dumptype \'global\'
    compress none
}
.fi
.PP
Note that multiple inheritance is also supported by simply naming multiple parent sections in a child\&. Parents are implicitly expanded in place in a child, and the last occurrence of each parameter takes precedence\&. For example,
.sp
.nf
define tapetype par1 {
    comment "Parent 1"
    filemark 8k
    speed 300bps
    length 200M
}
define tapetype par2 {
    comment "Parent 2"
    filemark 16k
    speed 400bps
}
define tapetype child {
    par1
    par2
    filemark 32k
}
.fi
In this example, \'child\' will have a filemark of 32k, a speed of 400bps, and a length of 200M\&.
.SH "GLOBAL PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBorg\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI"daily"\fR\&. A descriptive name for the configuration\&. This string appears in the Subject line of mail reports\&. Each Amanda configuration should have a different string to keep mail reports distinct\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmailer\fR \fIstring\fR

Default found by configure\&. A mail program that can send mail with \'\fIMAILER \-s "subject" user < message_file\fR\'\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmailto\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Default: none\&. A space separated list of recipients for mail reports\&. If not specified, amdump will not send any mail\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsend\-amreport\-on\fR [ \fBall\fR | \fBstrange\fR | \fBerror\fR | \fBnever\fR ]
.RS 4
Default:
\fBall\fR\&. Specify which types of messages will trigger an email from amreport\&. amreport is used by amdump and amflush\&.
.PP
\fBall\fR
.RS 4
Send an email on any message\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstrange\fR
.RS 4
Send an email on strange or error message\&. A strange message occurs when the dump succeeded, but returned one or more errors unknown to Amanda\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBerror\fR
.RS 4
Send an email only on error messages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBnever\fR
.RS 4
Never send an email\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBdumpcycle\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI10 days\fR\&. The number of days in the backup cycle\&. Each disk will get a full backup at least this often\&. Setting this to zero tries to do a full backup each run\&.
.if n \{\
.sp

This parameter may also be set in a specific
\fBdumptype\fR
(see below)\&. This value sets the default for all
\fBdumptype\fRs so must appear in
\fBamanda\&.conf\fR
before any
\fBdumptype\fRs are defined\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBrunspercycle\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIsame as dumpcycle\fR\&. The number of amdump runs in
\fBdumpcycle\fR
days\&. A value of 0 means the same value as
\fBdumpcycle\fR\&. A value of \-1 means guess the number of runs from the
\fBtapelist\fR(5)
file, which is the number of tapes used in the last
\fBdumpcycle\fR
days /
\fBruntapes\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapecycle\fR \fIint\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI15 tapes\fR\&. Typically tapes are used by Amanda in an ordered rotation\&. The
\fBtapecycle\fR
parameter defines the size of that rotation\&. This parameter must be be larger than the number of tapes used in a dumpcycle\&.
.sp
The number of tapes per dumpcycle is calculated by multiplying the number of
\fBamdump\fR
runs per dump cycle
\fBrunspercycle\fR
(the number of
\fBamdump\fR
runs per dump cycle) and
\fBruntapes\fR
(the number of tapes used per run)\&. Typically
\fBtapecycle\fR
is set to two or four times the tapes per dumpcycle\&.

.ps +1
\fBNote\fR
.ps -1
.br
Amanda is commonly misconfigured with \fBtapecycle\fR
equal to the number of tapes per \fBdumpcycle\fR\&.  In this
misconfiguration, amanda may erase a full dump before a new one is completed,
the recovery is then impossible\&. tapecycle must be at least one tape larger
than the number of tapes per dumpcycle\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
While Amanda is always willing to use a new tape in its rotation, it refuses to reuse a tape until at least \'\fBtapecycle\fR
\-1\' number of other tapes have been used\&.
.sp
It is considered good administrative practice to set the
\fBtapecycle\fR
parameter slightly lower than the actual number of tapes in rotation\&. This allows the administrator to more easily cope with damaged or misplaced tapes or schedule adjustments that call for slight adjustments in the rotation order\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBusetimestamps\fR \fIbool\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fBYes\fR\&. This option allows Amanda to track multiple runs per calendar day\&. The only reason one might disable it is that Amanda versions before 2\&.5\&.1 can\'t read logfiles written when this option was enabled\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBlabel_new_tapes\fR \fIstring\fR
.RS 4
Deprecated, use
\fBautolabel\fR
option\&.
.sp
Default: not set\&. When set, this directive will cause Amanda to automatically write an Amanda tape label to any blank tape she encounters\&. This option is DANGEROUS because when set, Amanda will ERASE any non\-Amanda tapes you may have, and may also ERASE any near\-failing tapes\&. Use with caution\&.
.sp
When using this directive, specify the template for new tape labels\&. The template should contain some number of contiguous \'%\' characters, which will be replaced with a generated number\&. Be sure to specify enough \'%\' characters that you do not run out of tape labels\&. Example:
\fBlabel_new_tapes "DailySet1\-%%%"\fR
.RE

Default: not set\&. When set, this directive will cause Amanda to automatically write an Amanda tape label to most volume she encounters\&. This option is DANGEROUS because when set, Amanda may erase near\-failing tapes or tapes accidentally loaded in the wrong slot\&.
.sp
When using this directive, specify the template for new tape labels\&. The template should contain some number of contiguous \'%\' characters, which will be replaced with a generated number\&. Be sure to specify enough \'%\' characters that you do not run out of tape labels\&. Example:

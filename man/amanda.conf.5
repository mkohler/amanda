.SH "NAME"
amanda.conf - Main configuration file for Amanda, the Advanced Maryland Automatic Network Disk Archiver
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fIamanda\.conf\fR
is the main configuration file for
\fIAmanda\fR\. This manpage lists the relevant sections and parameters of this file for quick reference\.
.PP
The file
\fB<CONFIG_DIR>/<config>/amanda\.conf\fR
is loaded\.
.SH "PARAMETERS"
.PP
There are a number of configuration parameters that control the behavior of the
\fIAmanda\fR
programs\. All have default values, so you need not specify the parameter in
\fBamanda\.conf\fR
if the default is suitable\.
.PP
Lines starting with # are ignored, as are blank lines\. Comments may be placed on a line with a directive by starting the comment with a #\. The remainder of the line is ignored\.
.PP
Keywords are case insensitive, i\.e\.
\fBmailto\fR
and
\fBMailTo\fR
are treated the same\.
.PP
Integer arguments may have one of the following (case insensitive) suffixes, some of which have a multiplier effect:

Note
The value
\fBinf\fR
may be used in most places where an integer is expected to mean an infinite amount\.
.sp
Boolean arguments may have any of the values
\fBy\fR,
\fByes\fR,
\fBt\fR,
\fBtrue\fR
or
\fBon\fR
to indicate a true state, or
\fBn\fR,

to indicate a false state\. If no argument is given,
\fBtrue\fR
is assumed\.
.RE
.SS "PARAMETERS"
.PP
\fBorg\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIdaily\fR\. A descriptive name for the configuration\. This string appears in the Subject line of mail reports\. Each
\fIAmanda\fR
configuration should have a different string to keep mail reports distinct\.
.RE
.PP
\fBmailto\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIoperators\fR\. A space separated list of recipients for mail reports\.
.RE
.PP
\fBdumpcycle\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI10 days\fR\. The number of days in the backup cycle\. Each disk will get a full backup at least this often\. Setting this to zero tries to do a full backup each run\.
.sp
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
Note
This parameter may also be set in a specific
\fBdumptype\fR
(see below)\. This value sets the default for all
\fBdumptype\fRs so must appear in
\fBamanda\.conf\fR
before any
\fBdumptype\fRs are defined\.
.RE
.PP
\fBrunspercycle\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIsame as dumpcycle\fR\. The number of amdump runs in
\fBdumpcycle\fR
days\. A value of 0 means the same value as
\fBdumpcycle\fR\. A value of \-1 means guess the number of runs from the
\fItapelist\fR
file, which is the number of tapes used in the last
\fBdumpcycle\fR
days /
\fBruntapes\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapecycle\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI15 tapes\fR\. Typically tapes are used by
\fIAmanda\fR
in an ordered rotation\. The
\fBtapecycle\fR
parameter defines the size of that rotation\. The number of tapes in rotation must be larger than the number of tapes required for a complete dump cycle (see the
\fBdumpcycle\fR
parameter)\.
.sp
This is calculated by multiplying the number of
\fBamdump\fR
runs per dump cycle (\fBrunspercycle\fR
parameter) times the number of tapes used per run (\fBruntapes\fR
parameter)\. Typically two to four times this calculated number of tapes are in rotation\. While
\fIAmanda\fR
is always willing to use a new tape in its rotation, it refuses to reuse a tape until at least \'\fBtapecycle\fR
\-1\' number of other tapes have been used\.
.sp
It is considered good administrative practice to set the
\fBtapecycle\fR
parameter slightly lower than the actual number of tapes in rotation\. This allows the administrator to more easily cope with damaged or misplaced tapes or schedule adjustments that call for slight adjustments in the rotation order\.
.RE
.PP
\fBusetimestamps\fR \fI bool\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fBYes\fR\. This option allows Amanda to track multiple runs per calendar day\. The only reason one might disable it is that Amanda versions before 2\.5\.1 can\'t read logfiles written when this option was enabled\.
.RE
.PP
\fBlabel_new_tapes\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default: not set\. When set, this directive will cause
\fIAmanda\fR
to automatically write an
\fIAmanda\fR
tape label to any blank tape she encounters\. This option is DANGEROUS because when set,
\fIAmanda\fR
will ERASE any non\-\fIAmanda\fR
tapes you may have, and may also ERASE any near\-failing tapes\. Use with caution\.
.sp
When using this directive, specify the template for new tape labels\. The template should contain some number of contiguous \'%\' characters, which will be replaced with a generated number\. Be sure to specify enough \'%\' characters that you do not run out of tape labels\. Example:
\fBlabel_new_tapes "DailySet1\-%%%"\fR
.RE
.PP
\fBdumpuser\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIamanda\fR\. The login name
\fIAmanda\fR
uses to run the backups\. The backup client hosts must allow access from the tape server host as this user via
\fB\.rhosts\fR
or
\fB\.amandahosts\fR, depending on how the
\fIAmanda\fR
software was built\.
.RE
.PP
\fBprinter\fR string
.RS 4
Printer to use when doing tape labels\. See the
\fBlbl\-templ\fR
\fBtapetype\fR
option\.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapedev\fR string
.RS 4
Default:
\fInull:\fR\. The path name of the non\-rewinding tape device\. Non\-rewinding tape device names often have an \'n\' in the name, e\.g\.
\fI/dev/rmt/0mn\fR, however this is operating system specific and you should consult that documentation for detailed naming information\.
.sp
If a tape changer is configured (see the
\fBtpchanger\fR
option), this option might not be used\.
.sp
If the
\fBnull\fR
output driver is selected (see the section OUTPUT DRIVERS in the
\fBamanda\fR(8)
manpage for more information), programs such as
\fBamdump\fR
will run normally but all images will be thrown away\. This should only be used for debugging and testing, and probably only with the
\fBrecord\fR
option set to
\fIno\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fBdevice_property\fR string string
.RS 4
These options can set various device properties, including block size, maximum volume usage, authentication information, hardware feature support, and more\.Specifics of how properties are used are device\-dependent, though some common properties are supported across multiple device drivers\.
.sp
Both strings are quoted; the first string contains the name of the property to set, and the second contains its value\. For example, to set a fixed block size of 128k, do:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
device_property "BLOCK_SIZE" "131072"
.fi
.RE
.sp
The order in which device properties are set is as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 1.\h'+02'Tapetype parameters, including length, blocksize, readblocksize, file\-pad, are translated into device properties and set accordingly\.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04' 2.\h'+02'Device properties from any device_property configuration directives are set, in the order they appear in the configuration file\.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBtpchanger\fR string
.RS 4
Default:
\fInone\fR\. The name of the tape changer\. If a tape changer is not configured, this option is not used and should be commented out of the configuration file\.
.sp
If a tape changer is configured, choose one of the changer scripts (e\.g\.
\fBchg\-scsi\fR) and enter that here\.
.RE
.PP
\fBchangerdev\fR string

\fI/dev/null\fR\. A tape changer configuration parameter\. Usage depends on the particular changer defined with the
\fBtpchanger\fR
option\.
.RE
.PP
\fBchangerfile\fR string
.RS 4
Default:
\fI/usr/adm/amanda/log/changer\-status\fR\. A tape changer configuration parameter\. Usage depends on the particular changer defined with the
\fBtpchanger\fR
option\.
.RE
.PP
\fBruntapes\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
1\. The maximum number of tapes used in a single run\. If a tape changer is not configured, this option is not used and should be commented out of the configuration file\.
.sp
If a tape changer is configured, this may be set larger than one to let
\fIAmanda\fR
write to more than one tape\.
.sp
Note that this is an upper bound on the number of tapes, and
\fIAmanda\fR
may use less\.
.sp
Also note that as of this release,
\fIAmanda\fR
does not support true tape overflow\. When it reaches the end of one tape, the backup image
\fIAmanda\fR
was processing starts over again on the next tape\.
.RE
.PP
\fBmaxdumpsize\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fIruntapes\fR*\fItape_length\fR\. Maximum number of bytes the planner will schedule for a run\.
.RE

Last in, first out\.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBlabelstr\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI\.*\fR\. The tape label constraint regular expression\. All tape labels generated (see
\fBamlabel\fR(8)) and used by this configuration must match the regular expression\. If multiple configurations are run from the same tape server host, it is helpful to set their labels to different strings (for example, "DAILY[0\-9][0\-9]*" vs\. "ARCHIVE[0\-9][0\-9]*") to avoid overwriting each other\'s tapes\.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapetype\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIEXABYTE\fR\. The type of tape drive associated with
\fBtapedev\fR
or
\fBtpchanger\fR\. This refers to one of the defined
\fBtapetype\fRs in the config file (see below), which specify various tape parameters, like the
\fBlength\fR,
\fBfilemark\fR
size, and
\fBspeed\fR
of the tape media and device\.
.sp
First character of a
\fBtapetype\fR
string must be an alphabetic character
.RE

\fBdtimeout\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI1800 seconds\fR\. Amount of idle time per disk on a given client that a
\fBdumper\fR
running from within
\fBamdump\fR
will wait before it fails with a data timeout error\.
.RE
.PP
\fBetimeout\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI300 seconds\fR\. Amount of time per estimate on a given client that the
\fBplanner\fR
step of
\fBamdump\fR
will wait to get the dump size estimates (note: Amanda runs up to 3 estimates for each DLE)\. For instance, with the default of 300 seconds and four DLE\'s, each estimating level 0 and level 1 on client A,
\fBplanner\fR
will wait up to 40 minutes for that machine\. A negative value will be interpreted as a total amount of time to wait per client instead of per disk\.
.RE
.PP
\fBconnect_tries\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI3\fR\. How many times the server will try a connection\.
.RE
.PP
\fBreq_tries\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI3\fR\. How many times the server will resend a REQ packet if it doesn\'t get the ACK packet\.
.RE
.PP
\fBnetusage\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI8000 Kbps\fR\. The maximum network bandwidth allocated to
\fIAmanda\fR, in Kbytes per second\. See also the
\fBinterface\fR
section\.
.RE
.PP
\fBinparallel\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
10\. The maximum number of backups that
\fIAmanda\fR
will attempt to run in parallel\.
\fIAmanda\fR
will stay within the constraints of network bandwidth and holding disk space available, so it doesn\'t hurt to set this number a bit high\. Some contention can occur with larger numbers of backups, but this effect is relatively small on most systems\.
.RE
.PP
\fBdisplayunit\fR "k|m|g|t"
.RS 4
Default:
"k"\. The unit used to print many numbers, k=kilo, m=mega, g=giga, t=tera\.
.RE
.PP
\fBdumporder\fR string
.RS 4
Default:
\fItttTTTTTTT\fR\. The priority order of each dumper:
.sp

B: largest bandwidth
.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fBmaxdumps\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
1\. The maximum number of backups from a single host that
\fIAmanda\fR
will attempt to run in parallel\. See also the
\fBinparallel\fR
option\.
.sp
Note that this parameter may also be set in a specific
\fBdumptype\fR
(see below)\. This value sets the default for all
\fBdumptype\fRs so must appear in
\fBamanda\.conf\fR
before any
\fBdumptype\fRs are defined\.
.RE
.PP
\fBbumpsize\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI10 Mbytes\fR\. The minimum savings required to trigger an automatic bump from one incremental level to the next, expressed as size\. If
\fIAmanda\fR
determines that the next higher backup level will be this much smaller than the current level, it will do the next level\. The value of this parameter is used only if the parameter
\fIbumppercent\fR
is set to 0\.
.sp
The global setting of this parameter can be overwritten inside of a dumptype\-definition\.
.sp
See also the options
\fBbumppercent\fR,
\fBbumpmult\fR
and
\fBbumpdays\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fBbumppercent\fR int
.RS 4
Default:
\fI0 percent\fR\. The minimum savings required to trigger an automatic bump from one incremental level to the next, expressed as percentage of the current size of the DLE (size of current level 0)\. If
\fIAmanda\fR
determines that the next higher backup level will be this much smaller than the current level, it will do the next level\.
.sp
If this parameter is set to 0, the value of the parameter
\fIbumpsize\fR
is used to trigger bumping\.
.sp
The global setting of this parameter can be overwritten inside of a dumptype\-definition\.

See also the options
\fBbumpsize\fR,
\fBbumpmult\fR
and
\fBbumpdays\fR\.
.RE
.PP
\fBbumpmult\fR \fI float\fR
.RS 4
Default:
1\.5\. The bump size multiplier\.
\fIAmanda\fR
multiplies
\fBbumpsize\fR
by this factor for each level\. This prevents active filesystems from bumping too much by making it harder to bump to the next level\. For example, with the default
\fBbumpsize\fR
and
\fBbumpmult\fR
set to 2\.0, the bump threshold will be 10 Mbytes for level one, 20 Mbytes for level two, 40 Mbytes for level three, and so on\.
.sp
The global setting of this parameter can be overwritten inside of a dumptype\-definition\.
.RE
.PP
\fBbumpdays\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI2 days\fR\. To insure redundancy in the dumps,
\fIAmanda\fR
keeps filesystems at the same incremental level for at least
\fBbumpdays\fR
days, even if the other bump threshold criteria are met\.
.sp
The global setting of this parameter can be overwritten inside of a dumptype\-definition\.
.RE
.PP
\fBdiskfile\fR \fI string\fR

\fIdisklist\fR
file holding client hosts, disks and other client dumping information\.
.RE
.PP
\fBinfofile\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI/usr/adm/amanda/curinfo\fR\. The file or directory name for the historical information database\. If
\fIAmanda\fR
was configured to use DBM databases, this is the base file name for them\. If it was configured to use text formated databases (the default), this is the base directory and within here will be a directory per client, then a directory per disk, then a text file of data\.
.RE
.PP
\fBlogdir\fR \fI string\fR

.RE
.PP
\fBindexdir\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default
\fI/usr/adm/amanda/index\fR\. The directory where index files (backup image catalogues) are stored\. Index files are only generated for filesystems whose

\fBindex\fR
option enabled\.
.RE
.PP
\fBtapelist\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:

\fBdevice_output_buffer_size\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
640k\. Controls the amount of memory used by

.RE
.PP
\fBtapebufs\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
20\. This option is deprecated; use the
\fBdevice_output_buffer_size\fR
directive instead\.
\fBtapebufs\fR
works the same way, but the number specified is multiplied by the device blocksize prior to use\.
.RE
.PP
\fBreserve\fR \fI number\fR
.RS 4
Default:
100\. The part of holding\-disk space that should be reserved for incremental backups if no tape is available, expressed as a percentage of the available holding\-disk space (0\-100)\. By default, when there is no tape to write to, degraded mode (incremental) backups will be performed to the holding disk\. If full backups should also be allowed in this case, the amount of holding disk space reserved for incrementals should be lowered\.
.RE

Default:
\fI0 Gb\fR\. Amount of space that can be used in this holding disk area\. If the value is zero, all available space on the file system is used\. If the value is negative,
\fIAmanda\fR
will use all available space minus that value\.
.RE

\fBchunksize\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI1 Gb\fR\. Holding disk chunk size\. Dumps larger than the specified size will be stored in multiple holding disk files\. The size of each chunk will not exceed the specified value\. However, even though dump images are split in the holding disk, they are concatenated as they are written to tape, so each dump image still corresponds to a single continuous tape section\.
.sp
If 0 is specified,
\fIAmanda\fR
will create holding disk chunks as large as ((INT_MAX/1024)\-64) Kbytes\.
.sp
Each holding disk chunk includes a 32 Kbyte header, so the minimum chunk size is 64 Kbytes (but that would be really silly)\.
.sp
Operating systems that are limited to a maximum file size of 2 Gbytes actually cannot handle files that large\. They must be at least one byte less than 2 Gbytes\. Since
\fIAmanda\fR
works with 32 Kbyte blocks, and to handle the final read at the end of the chunk, the chunk size should be at least 64 Kbytes (2 * 32 Kbytes) smaller than the maximum file size, e\.g\. 2047 Mbytes\.
.RE
.SH "DUMPTYPE SECTION"
.PP
The
\fIamanda\.conf\fR

.PP
A set of backup options are entered in a

Some of the options in a
\fBdumptype\fR

\fIamanda\.conf\fR\. The main option value is used to set the default for all
\fBdumptype\fR
sections\. For instance, setting
\fBdumpcycle\fR
to 50 in the main part of the config file causes all following
\fBdumptype\fR
sections to start with that value, but the value may be changed on a section by section basis\. Changes to variables in the main part of the config file must be done before (earlier in the file) any

\fI0 percent\fR\. The minimum savings required to trigger an automatic bump from one incremental level to the next, expressed as percentage of the current size of the DLE (size of current level 0)\. If
\fIAmanda\fR
determines that the next higher backup level will be this much smaller than the current level, it will do the next level\.

.RE
.PP
\fBbumpmult\fR \fI float\fR
.RS 4
Default:
1\.5\. The bump size multiplier\.
\fIAmanda\fR
multiplies
\fBbumpsize\fR
by this factor for each level\. This prevents active filesystems from bumping too much by making it harder to bump to the next level\. For example, with the default
\fBbumpsize\fR
and
\fBbumpmult\fR
set to 2\.0, the bump threshold will be 10 Mbytes for level one, 20 Mbytes for level two, 40 Mbytes for level three, and so on\.

Default:
0\.50,
0\.50\. The expected full and incremental compression factor for dumps\. It is only used if
\fIAmanda\fR
does not have any history information on compression rates for a filesystem, so should not usually need to be set\. However, it may be useful for the first time a very large filesystem that compresses very little is backed up\.
.RE
.PP
\fBcompress [client|server]\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fIclient fast\fR\. If
\fIAmanda\fR
does compression of the backup images, it can do so either on the backup client host before it crosses the network or on the tape server host as it goes from the network into the holding disk or to tape\. Which place to do compression (if at all) depends on how well the dump image usually compresses, the speed and load on the client or server, network capacity, holding disk capacity, availability of tape hardware compression, etc\.
.sp
For either type of compression,
\fIAmanda\fR
also allows the selection of three styles of compression\.
\fBBest\fR
is the best compression available, often at the expense of CPU overhead\.
\fBFast\fR
is often not as good a compression as
\fBbest\fR, but usually less CPU overhead\. Or to specify
\fBCustom\fR
to use your own compression method\. (See dumptype custom\-compress in example/amanda\.conf for reference)
.sp

.RE
.PP
\fBdumpcycle\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:

\fBencrypt [none|client|server]\fR

\fBreadblocksize\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default: (\fIfrom configure \-\-with\-maxtapeblocksize\fR)\. How much data will be read in each tape record expressed in KiloBytes\. Some hardware require a value not too large, and some require it to be equal to the blocksize\. It is useful if you configured amanda with a big \-\-with\-maxtapeblocksize and your hardware don\'t work with a value that big\.
.RE
.PP
\fBfile\-pad\fR \fI boolean\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fItrue\fR\. If true, every record, including the last one in the file, will have the same length\. This matches the way
\fIAmanda\fR
wrote tapes prior to the availability of this parameter\. It may also be useful on devices that only support a fixed blocksize\.
.sp
Note that the last record on the tape probably includes trailing null byte padding, which will be passed back to
\fBgzip\fR,
\fBcompress\fR
or the restore program\. Most programs just ignore this (although possibly with a warning)\.
.sp
If this parameter is false, the last record in a file may be shorter than the block size\. The file will contain the same amount of data the dump program generated, without trailing null byte padding\. When read, the same amount of data that was written will be returned\.
.RE
.PP
\fBspeed\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI200 bps\fR\. How fast the drive will accept data, in bytes per second\. This parameter is NOT currently used by
\fIAmanda\fR\.

\fBlbl\-templ\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
A PostScript template file used by
\fBamreport\fR
to generate labels\. Several sample files are provided with the
\fIAmanda\fR
sources in the
\fIexample\fR
directory\. See the
\fBamreport\fR(8)
man page for more information\.
.RE
.PP
In addition to options, another
\fBtapetype\fR
name may be entered, which makes this
\fBtapetype\fR
inherit options from another
\fBtapetype\fR\. For instance, the only difference between a DLT4000 tape drive using Compact\-III tapes and one using Compact\-IV tapes is the length of the tape\. So they could be entered as:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
define tapetype DLT4000\-III {
    comment "DLT4000 tape drives with Compact\-III tapes"
    length 12500 mbytes         # 10 Gig tapes with some compression
    filemark 2000 kbytes
    speed 1536 kps
}
define tapetype DLT4000\-IV {
    DLT4000\-III
    comment "DLT4000 tape drives with Compact\-IV tapes"
    length 25000 mbytes         # 20 Gig tapes with some compression
}

.SH "INTERFACE SECTION"
.PP
The
\fBamanda\.conf\fR
file may define multiple types of network interfaces\. The information is entered in an
\fBinterface\fR
section, which looks like this:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
define interface \fIname\fR {
    \fIinterface\-option\fR \fIinterface\-value\fR
    \.\.\.
}
.fi
.RE
.PP
\fIname\fR
is the name of this type of network interface\. It is referenced from the
\fIdisklist\fR
file\.
.PP
Note that these sections define network interface characteristics, not the actual interface that will be used\. Nor do they impose limits on the bandwidth that will actually be taken up by
\fIAmanda\fR\.
\fIAmanda\fR
computes the estimated bandwidth each file system backup will take based on the estimated size and time, then compares that plus any other running backups with the limit as another of the criteria when deciding whether to start the backup\. Once a backup starts,
\fIAmanda\fR
will use as much of the network as it can leaving throttling up to the operating system and network hardware\.
.PP
The interface options and values are:
.PP
\fBcomment\fR \fI string\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fInone\fR\. A comment string describing this set of network information\.
.RE
.PP
\fBuse\fR \fI int\fR
.RS 4
Default:
\fI8000 Kbps\fR\. The speed of the interface in Kbytes per second\.
.RE
.PP
In addition to options, another
\fBinterface\fR
name may be entered, which makes this
\fBinterface\fR
inherit options from another
\fBinterface\fR\. At the moment, this is of little use\.

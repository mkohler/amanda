.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBAmcleanup\fR generates the \fB\fBAMANDA\fR Mail Report\fR and updates the \fBAMANDA\fR databases after a system failure on a tape server host\&. This cleanup process is normally done automatically as part of the \fBamdump\fR program, but if \fBamdump\fR cannot complete for some reason (usually because of a tape server host crash), \fBamcleanup\fR must be run some time later (usually during system boot)\&.

.PP
See the \fBamanda\fR(8) man page for more details about \fBAMANDA\fR\&.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

.PP
This example runs the \fBAMANDA\fR cleanup process by hand after a failure\&.
.nf

% amcleanup daily
.fi

.PP
Putting the following line in a system boot script (e\&.g\&. \fI/etc/rc\&.local\fR) runs the \fBAMANDA\fR cleanup process as part of the reboot, eliminating the need to run it by hand\&.
.nf

/usr/local/sbin/amcleanup daily
.fi

.PP
If nothing needs to be done, \fBamcleanup\fR exits normally with the message:
.nf

amcleanup: no unprocessed logfile to clean up\&.
.fi

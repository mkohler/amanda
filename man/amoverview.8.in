.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Amoverview
displays a chart showing hosts and file systems processed by Amanda
along with the backup level performed each day.
.LP
See the
.IR amanda (8)
man page for more details about Amanda.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.OP -config config
Use configuration
.I config
instead of @DEFAULT_CONFIG@.
.TP
.OP -hostwidth width
Set
.B host
field column width to
.I width
characters instead of eight.
.TP
.OP -diskwidth width
Set
.B disk
field column width to
.I width
characters instead of 20.
.TP
.B -verbose
.B Amoverview
can take a long while on large systems.
This option reports intermediate steps while it is working.
.SH RESULTS
.B amoverview
is a summary of the output of "
.B amadmin <config> find
".
When the last column of 
.B amadmin find
contains anything other than "OK",
amoverview translates this into 'E' for that day.

A number indicates the level of backup and it succeeded.
An "E" indicates an error for that day.
You get an 'E' for all errors, like failed to connect, datatimeout,
computer crashed, etc, but also for failing to write to tape.

You can have an "E" followed by a number if a filesystem ran into
end-of-tape once (gives an 'E', and later that day, you flush it to a
second tape (a number: the level, indicating success).  If the flush
failed too, you get a double "EE" for that day.

You can also have a double code if you have two tapes in the changer and
amanda failed to write to tape the first time because it hit end of tape
(resulting in "E0", for a full, "E1" for an incremental etc)
or twice with error ("EE"), and may a successfull flush afterwards
giving maybe "EE0".  (Only the latest 2 characters are printed).
.SH EXAMPLE
This shows the
.I /home
file system on
.I host2
was backed up at level 3 on the 8th, 9th and 10th of December,
had a full backup on the 11th,
a level 1 on the 12th and a level 2 on the 13th.

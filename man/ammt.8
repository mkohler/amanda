.SH "DESCRIPTION"

.PP
\fBAmmt\fR provides just enough of the standard UNIX \fBmt\fR command for the needs of \fBAMANDA\fR\&. This is handy when doing a full restore and the standard \fBmt\fR program has not yet been found\&.

.PP
\fBAmmt\fR also provides access to the \fBAMANDA\fR output drivers that support various tape simulations\&.

.PP
See the \fBamanda\fR(8) man page for more details about \fBAMANDA\fR\&. See the \fBOUTPUT DRIVERS\fR section of \fBamanda(8)\fR for more information on the \fBAMANDA\fR output drivers\&.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Turn on debugging output\&.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR\fI device\fR
Access tape device \fBdevice\fR\&. If not specified, the \fBTAPE\fR environment variable is used\&.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR\fI device\fR
Same as \fB\-f\fR\&.

.TP
\fBcommand\fR\fB count\fR
Which command to issue, and an optional count of operations\&.

.SH "COMMANDS"

.PP
Each command may be abbreviated to whatever length makes it unique\&.

.TP
\fBeof|weof\fR\fB count\fR
Write \fBcount\fR (default: 1) end of file marks (tapemarks)\&.

.TP
\fBfsf\fR\fB count\fR
Skip forward \fBcount\fR (default: 1) files\&.

.TP
\fBbsf\fR\fB count\fR
Skip backward \fBcount\fR (default: 1) files\&.

.TP
\fBasf\fR\fB count\fR
Position to file number \fBcount\fR (default: 0) where zero is beginning of tape\&. This is the same as a \fBrewind\fR followed by a \fBfsf\fR  \fBcount\fR\&.

.TP
\fBrewind\fR
Rewind to beginning of tape\&.

.TP
\fBoffline|rewoffl\fR
Rewind to beginning of tape and unload the tape from the drive\&.

.TP
\fBstatus\fR
Report status information about the drive\&. Which data reported, and what it means, depends on the underlying operating system, and may include:

.RS

.TP
ONLINE
Indicates the drive is online and ready\&.

.TP
OFFLINE
Indicates the drive is offline or not ready\&.

.TP
BOT
Indicates the drive is at beginning of tape\&.

.TP
EOT
Indicates the drive is at end of tape\&.

.TP
PROTECTED
Indicates the tape is write protected\&.

.TP
ds
Device status\&.

.TP
er
Error register\&.

.TP
fileno
Current tape file number\&.

.TP
blkno
Current tape block number file\&.

.RE
.IP

.RS
.Sh "Note"

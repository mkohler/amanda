.SH "NAME"
amcrypt-ossl - crypt program for Amanda symmetric data encryption using OpenSSL
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBamcrypt-ossl\fR [-d]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBamcrypt-ossl\fR
uses
\fBOpenSSL\fR
to encrypt and decrypt data. OpenSSL is available from
www.openssl.org. OpenSSL offers a wide variety of cipher choices (
\fBamcrypt-ossl\fR
defaults to 256-bit AES) and can use hardware cryptographic accelerators on several platforms.
.PP
\fBamcrypt-ossl\fR
will search for the OpenSSL program in the following directories: /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/ssl/bin:/usr/local/ssl/bin.
.SH "PASSPHRASE MANAGEMENT"
.PP
\fBamcrypt-ossl\fR
uses the same pass phrase to encrypt and decrypt data. It is very important to store and protect the pass phrase properly. Encrypted backup data can
\fBonly\fR
be recovered with the correct passphrase.
.PP
OpenSSL's key derivation routines use a salt to guard against dictionary attacks on the pass phrase; still it is important to pick a pass phrase that is hard to guess. The Diceware method (see
www.diceware.com) can be used to create passphrases that are difficult to guess and easy to remember.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
/var/lib/amanda/.am_passphrase
File containing the pass phrase. It should not be readable by any user other than the
\fBAmanda\fR
user.

.SH "NAME"
amgpgcrypt - reference crypt program for Amanda public-key data encryption
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 11
\fBamgpgcrypt\fR  to be called by \fIAmanda\fR only 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBamgpgcrypt\fR
calls
\fBgpg\fR
to perform public\-key data encryption on
\fIAmanda\fR
backup\.
\fBamgpgcrypt\fR
will search for the gpg program in the following directories: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/sbin
.PP

\fBamgpgcrypt\fR
sets GNUPGHOME to $AMANDA_HOME/\.gnupg where gpg will look for the gpg keys\.
\fBamgpgcrypt\fR
uses the public key to encrypt the
\fIAmanda\fR
data and uses the private key to decrypt the
\fIAmanda\fR
backup data\. Thus, passphrase is only required at the time of data restore\.
.SH "KEY AND PASSPHRASE"
.PP

\fBamgpgcrypt\fR
uses the private key to decrypt
\fIAmanda\fR
backup data\.

It is very important to store, manage and  protect the key and the passphrase
properly\. Encrypted backup data can \fBonly\fR be recovered with the correct key and
passphrase\.
.SH "HOW TO CREATE ENCRYPTION KEYS AND PASSPHRASE FOR AMGPGCRYPT"
.PP
Store the passphrase that you used in following "gpg \-\-gen\-key" command inside the home\-directory of the AMANDA\-user($amanda_user) and protect it with proper permissions:

   echo my_secret_passphrase > ~$amanda_user/\.am_passphrase
   chown $amanda_user:disk ~$amanda_user/\.am_passphrase
   chmod 700 ~$amanda_user/\.am_passphrase
.PP
Run "gpg \-\-gen\-key"\. Below is an example:
.sp
.RS 4
.nf
$ gpg \-\-gen\-key

About to generate a new ELG\-E keypair\.
              minimum keysize is  768 bits
              default keysize is 1024 bits
    highest suggested keysize is 2048 bits
What keysize do you want? (1024)
Requested keysize is 1024 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid\.
         0 = key does not expire
      (n)  = key expires in n days
      (n)w = key expires in n weeks
      (n)m = key expires in n months
      (n)y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 6m
Key expires at Sun 06 Aug 2006 03:51:25 PM PDT
Is this correct (y/n)? y

You need a User\-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user id
from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) (heinrichh@duesseldorf\.de)"

Real name: amandabackup
Email address:
Comment: gpg keys for amandabackup
You selected this USER\-ID:
    "amandabackup (gpg keys for amandabackup)"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key\.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes\. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy\.
